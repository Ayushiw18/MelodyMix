# Music Playlist Management

This project is a simple music playlist manager application built in Java. It allows users to add, delete, search, play, and organize songs in a playlist. The playlist is stored in a doubly linked list, and song data is written to a text file for persistence. The application also features a recently played songs list and allows songs to be sorted.

## Features

1. **Add New Song**: Allows the user to add new songs to the playlist.
2. **Delete Song**: Delete songs either by searching for them or by their position in the playlist.
3. **Display Playlist**: Displays the entire playlist with all the songs.
4. **Count Total Songs**: Displays the total number of songs in the playlist.
5. **Search Song**: Search for a song by its name.
6. **Play Song**: Allows the user to play a song from the playlist. It also adds it to the recently played songs list.
7. **Recently Played List**: Displays the songs that were most recently played.
8. **Last Played Song**: Shows the last song that was played.
9. **Sort Playlist**: Sorts the playlist alphabetically.
10. **Add Songs from File**: Allows you to load songs into the playlist from a text file (`playlist.txt`).
11. **Persistent Storage**: Songs are saved in a file (`playlist.txt`), which allows the playlist to persist between application runs.
